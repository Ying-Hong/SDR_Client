Introduction
------------

Numerics.NET (formerly Extreme Optimization Numerical Libraries for .NET) is a solid
foundation for your numerical computing needs on the Microsoft .NET platform, 
including .NET Core and on Linux.

Its broad base of algorithms covers a wide range of numerical techniques, including: 
linear algebra, numerical integration and differentiation, solving equations, optimization,
curve fitting, statistical models, and much more.

The classes in Numerics.NET and the relationships between them match our every-day 
concepts, and breaks new ground in usability for numerical software development.

We implemented the best algorithms available today to provide you with great performance 
on a robust, fast toolset.
